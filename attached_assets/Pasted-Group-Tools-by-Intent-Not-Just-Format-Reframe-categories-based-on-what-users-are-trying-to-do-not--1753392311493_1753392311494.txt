Group Tools by Intent, Not Just Format
Reframe categories based on what users are trying to do, not just technical format:

Current Category	Suggested UX-Driven Category
🧩 File Converters	📂 Convert Files (Docs, Media, Code)
📄 PDF Tools	📝 Create or Edit PDFs
✍️ Text Tools	🔤 Edit or Analyze Text
</> Developer Tools	👨‍💻 Code Utilities
🎨 Images & Colors	🎨 Image + Color Tools
📊 Spreadsheet Tools	📈 Data + Spreadsheets

This helps users think less and click faster — like Canva does by organizing templates by goal (“Social Media Post” vs “Facebook Ad”).

2. Display 1 Featured Tool Per Category on Home Page
Instead of showing all tools, go with:

plaintext
Copy code
🧰 Convert Files
"Convert files between CSV, JSON, PDF, Image & more — in your browser."
[Try CSV Converter] → View all file converters

🎨 Image & Color Tools
"Compress, convert, and extract colors from images locally."
[Try Image Optimizer] → View all image tools
✅ This reduces visual fatigue, guides new users, and gives room for call-to-action links like:

“More tools”

“Power user? Download our Pro App”

“Work offline?”

3. Use Cards with Visual Consistency
Each tool should follow a uniform card style:

plaintext
Copy code
🖼️ Tool Name
Short subtitle (max 2 lines)
🔥 #X Popular | 🆕 | Local Only
[Launch Tool]
Or allow quick actions like:

⭐ Favorite

↗ Open in new tab

📝 Add to custom toolkit (for logged-in users if added later)

4. Add Clear CTAs for Paid App / Affiliates
Since you're earning via Grammarly, Canva, NordVPN, etc., try:

plaintext
Copy code
🧰 Want more features?

Use bottom banners or tool sidebar ads (non-intrusive, inline style).

5. Color Palette for Light Mode
Stick to a warm-neutral and minimal palette:

UI Element	Suggested Color
Background	#F8F9FA or #FCFCFC
Cards	#FFFFFF with #EDEDED border
Titles / Headers	#212529 (dark gray)
Body text	#495057 (muted gray)
Icons / Highlights	#007BFF (blue) or #5C6AC4 (Canva tone)
Buttons	Light blue or soft teal
Category Labels	Soft pastel icons (SVG)

Use drop shadows sparingly to lift cards subtly:

css
Copy code
box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);
6. Add a “Tool of the Day” Section
Highlight 1 lesser-known tool each day/week:

🔍 Tool Spotlight: Text Diff Checker
Compare two blocks of text with detailed difference reports. Useful for version tracking and proofreading.

Would you like a redesigned homepage layout in code or Figma-style wireframe based on this structure?
