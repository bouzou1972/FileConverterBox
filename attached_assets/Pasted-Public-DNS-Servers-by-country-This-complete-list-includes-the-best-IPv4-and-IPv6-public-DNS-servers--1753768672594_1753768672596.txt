The DNS (Domain Name System) is the system that translates the domain names user enter in the browser to the IP addresses required to access a website. Mostly, the user's computer is connected with the DNS servers assigned by an ISP. But those might not be the best DNS servers to consider.

Slow DNS servers may cause a lag before the website starts to load. And suppose if your DNS server goes down, you will not be able to access the required website. Switching to public DNS servers is the best choice and offers an alternative way to secure your connectivity. More reliability, durability, responsive time, and 100% uptime result in fewer technical issues.

Public DNS Servers List
The database contains all free and public DNS servers to choose to replace the original ones configured by your ISP.

This list includes the IPv4 and IPv6 public DNS servers in the world.

What is a public DNS server?
The public DNS server is the nameserver that networked computers may use to resolve the DNS query. That may be used in place of (or in addition to) the DNS servers assigned by your ISP. These are publicly available, and anyone can easily access them.

The public DNS server is also called a public recursive nameserver or public DNS resolver.

What are the reasons to use public DNS servers?
Even five years ago, ISP assigned DNS servers was sufficient to browse the internet. With time, the web pages get more complex.

Today, the DNS servers have to perform multiple lookups to display one website. That might increase the latency of the DNS server and hence slow down the browsing experience significantly.

According to YSlow, DNS lookups take 20 to 120 milliseconds to complete.

The main reasons to use the public DNS servers are

faster web browsing speed
improved reliability and stability
protection against phishing and other malicious websites
improved security
parental control to protect their family
censorship bypass to access the geo-blocked content
the DNS propagation process is fast compared to ISP DNS servers
Which are the best public DNS servers?
Some of the best DNS servers are

Open DNS
Cloudflare DNS
Google Public DNS
Quad9 DNS
Like any other business, the DNS provider can also shut down. For example, Norton ConnectSafe was a well-recognized public DNS resolver, but it shut down its business in November 2018. So be aware of it and keep an eye on the service once you are settled with the one.

The internet speed also depends on how close a DNS resolver to your location. If your area is located near an OpenDNS PoP, then OpenDNS is the best option. If it's located almost 2,500 miles from the OpenDNS PoP, it's better to use a local DNS service.

Can you use a mix of DNS servers?
Yes, you can mix the DNS servers. You can use the Google Public DNS as the primary DNS server and OpenDNS as your secondary DNS server; it will improve redundancy in case of failure of the Primary DNS server.

Is changing DNS dangerous?
Changing your current DNS settings to a reliable public DNS server is safe. These changes are reversible and beneficial adjustments that will not harm your computer or network.

What is my DNS?
Usually, your ISP provides the DNS server that handles all the DNS queries from your computer.

In Windows 10, Open the cmd and run the "ipconfig /all" command. You will see that information in front of your DNS Servers heading.

To change your DNS settings in Windows, MAC OS, and Ubuntu, you can get the information from here.
