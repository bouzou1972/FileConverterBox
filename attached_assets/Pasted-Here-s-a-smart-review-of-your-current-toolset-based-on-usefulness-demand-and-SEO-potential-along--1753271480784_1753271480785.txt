Here’s a smart review of your current toolset based on usefulness, demand, and SEO potential, along with suggestions for new tools to add that users actively search for.

✅ Highly Useful Tools (Keep)
These are frequently searched, developer-friendly, and practical:

CSV ↔ JSON/YAML/TSV – 💯 Must-have. Structured data conversion is widely needed.

Regex Tester – Useful for developers; great for SEO if optimized.

Timestamp Converter – Niche but valuable. Keep with timezone support.

UUID Generator – Lightweight but useful. Consider combining with other dev tools.

JSON Formatter – High demand. Keep.

Markdown to HTML – Helpful for developers and writers. Keep.

PDF Converter – Keep, especially if you support HTML/text/image input.

PNG to PDF Converter – Specific and useful. Good SEO target.

⚠️ Less Useful or Niche (Consider Removing or Merging)
Lorem Ipsum Generator – Low utility today; tons of online options already.
👉 Consider removing unless you're bundling it with other design/dev tools.

PDF to PPT Converter – This has limited use and might require heavier resources or external libraries.
👉 Consider replacing with something more relevant or lightweight unless demand is proven.
